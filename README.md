- The MERN stack is a popular JavaScript stack which is used for building modern day web applications. MERN is an acronym that stands for: MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js

**MongoDB:** MongoDB is a NoSQL database that stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents. MongoDB is highly scalable, flexible, and easy to use. This makes it a popular choice for web applications that require handling data in a more dynamic and flexible way.

**Express.js:** Express.js is a flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a set of features for building web and mobile applications. Express.js uses its robust set of features to simplify the process of building web servers and handling HTTP requests.

**React:** React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces (UI). It allows developers to create reusable (UI) components that efficiently updates and render data as it changes. React's component-based architecture and virtual DOM make it well-suited for building dynamic and interactive user interfaces.

**Node.js:** Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. It enables developers to run JavaScript code outside of a web browser, making it possible to build server-side applications using JavaScript. Node.js is highly efficient and scalable, making it a popular choice for building backend services in the MERN stack.
- ### Getting the location of Nodejs software from Ubuntu repositories 
curl is the command-line tool used to transfer data from or to a server. It is commonly used to download files or web pages from URLs.
This command downloads a script from NodeSource's website, which is responsible for setting up the Node.js 18.x repository on the system. The script is then executed with elevated privileges using sudo. This is a common way to install Node.js on Debian-based Linux distributions.
```
curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_18.x | sudo -E bash -
```

- ### Install Node.js
```
sudo apt-get install -y nodejs
```
The command above installs both nodejs and npm. NPM is a package manager for Node like apt for Ubuntu, it is used to install Node modules & packages and to manage dependency conflicts. 

```
node -v
```

the node -v command is used to verify the node installation/version of node.js installed on your machine

- ### Application code setup: Create a new directory for your To-Do project
N/B: Directories are case sensitive Hence, "Todo" is not the same as "todo". 
```
mkdir Todo
```
N/B: After creating the Todo directory, run the ls command to verify that the Todo directory is created 
```
ls
```

change your current directory to the newly created Todo directory

```
cd Todo
```
- ### Initialize your Todo applicaiton project directory. 
```
npm init
```
Next, you will use the command npm init to initialise your project, so that a new file named package.json will be created. This file will normally contain information about your application and the dependencies that it needs to run. Follow the prompts after running the command. You can press Enter several times to accept default values, then accept to write out the package.json file by typing yes.

- **PS: The npm init command is used to initialize a new Node.js project by creating a package.json file. When you run npm init, npm (Node Package Manager) guides you through a series of prompts to gather information about your project, such as its name, version, description, entry point, test command, author, license, etc. Based on your responses, npm generates a package.json file with the provided metadata.**

- **Here's what happens when you run npm init:**

1. Prompts for Project Information: npm prompts you to provide information about your project. It asks questions such as the project name, version, description, entry point (main file), test command, repository URL, author name, license, etc.

2. User Input: You enter the requested information for each prompt. You can press Enter to accept the default value (shown in parentheses) or type your own value.

3. Package.json Generation: Once you've provided all the necessary information, npm generates a package.json file based on your responses. This file contains metadata about your project and is used by npm to manage dependencies, scripts, and other project-related settings.

4. The package.json file is crucial for Node.js projects as it serves as a manifest for the project, listing its dependencies, scripts for running tasks, and other metadata. It's used by npm to install dependencies, run scripts, and manage project settings. Creating a package.json file using npm init is typically the first step when starting a new Node.js project.
