# MERN-STACK-APPLICATION
## A To-do web application implementation on a MERN Stack
- The MERN stack is a popular JavaScript stack which is used for building modern day web applications. MERN is an acronym that stands for: MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js

**MongoDB:** MongoDB is a NoSQL database that stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents. MongoDB is highly scalable, flexible, and easy to use. This makes it a popular choice for web applications that require handling data in a more dynamic and flexible way.

**Express.js:** Express.js is a flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a set of features for building web and mobile applications. Express.js uses its robust set of features to simplify the process of building web servers and handling HTTP requests.

**React:** React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces (UI). It allows developers to create reusable UI components that efficiently updates and render data as it changes. React's component-based architecture and virtual DOM make it well-suited for building dynamic and interactive user interfaces.

**Node.js:** Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. It enables developers to run JavaScript code outside of a web browser, making it possible to build server-side applications using JavaScript. Node.js is highly efficient and scalable, making it a popular choice for building backend services in the MERN stack.
