- The MERN stack is a popular JavaScript stack which is used for building modern day web applications. MERN is an acronym that stands for: MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js

**MongoDB:** MongoDB is a NoSQL database that stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents. MongoDB is highly scalable, flexible, and easy to use. This makes it a popular choice for web applications that require handling data in a more dynamic and flexible way.

**Express.js:** Express.js is a flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a set of features for building web and mobile applications. Express.js uses its robust set of features to simplify the process of building web servers and handling HTTP requests.

**React:** React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces (UI). It allows developers to create reusable (UI) components that efficiently updates and render data as it changes. React's component-based architecture and virtual DOM make it well-suited for building dynamic and interactive user interfaces.

**Node.js:** Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. It enables developers to run JavaScript code outside of a web browser, making it possible to build server-side applications using JavaScript. Node.js is highly efficient and scalable, making it a popular choice for building backend services in the MERN stack.
- ### Getting the location of Nodejs software from Ubuntu repositories 
curl is the command-line tool used to transfer data from or to a server. It is commonly used to download files or web pages from URLs.
This command downloads a script from NodeSource's website, which is responsible for setting up the Node.js 18.x repository on the system. The script is then executed with elevated privileges using sudo. This is a common way to install Node.js on Debian-based Linux distributions.
```
curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_18.x | sudo -E bash -
```

- ### Install Node.js
```
sudo apt-get install -y nodejs
```
The command above installs both nodejs and npm. NPM is a package manager for Node like apt for Ubuntu, it is used to install Node modules & packages and to manage dependency conflicts. 

```
node -v
```

the node -v command is used to verify the node installation/version of node.js installed on your machine

- ### Application code setup: Create a new directory for your To-Do project
N/B: Directories are case sensitive Hence, "Todo" is not the same as "todo". 
```
mkdir Todo
```
N/B: After creating the Todo directory, run the ls command to verify that the Todo directory is created 
```
ls
```
![image](./screenshots/todo-directory.png)

change your current directory to the newly created Todo directory

```
cd Todo
```
- ### Initialize your Todo applicaiton project directory
```
npm init
```
Next, you will use the command npm init to initialise your project, so that a new file named package.json will be created. This file will normally contain information about your application and the dependencies that it needs to run. Follow the prompts after running the command. You can press Enter several times to accept default values, then accept to write out the package.json file by typing yes.

- **PS: The npm init command is used to initialize a new Node.js project by creating a package.json file. When you run npm init, npm (Node Package Manager) guides you through a series of prompts to gather information about your project, such as its name, version, description, entry point, test command, author, license, etc. Based on your responses, npm generates a package.json file with the provided metadata.**

- **Here's what happens when you run npm init:**

1. Prompts for Project Information: npm prompts you to provide information about your project. It asks questions such as the project name, version, description, entry point (main file), test command, repository URL, author name, license, etc.

2. User Input: You enter the requested information for each prompt. You can press Enter to accept the default value (shown in parentheses) or type your own value.

3. Package.json Generation: Once you've provided all the necessary information, npm generates a package.json file based on your responses. This file contains metadata about your project and is used by npm to manage dependencies, scripts, and other project-related settings.

4. The package.json file is crucial for Node.js projects as it serves as a manifest for the project, listing its dependencies, scripts for running tasks, and other metadata. It's used by npm to install dependencies, run scripts, and manage project settings. Creating a package.json file using npm init is typically the first step when starting a new Node.js project.
                    ***helpful tip yeah!!! ðŸ˜Š***

while still in the Todo directory, run the ls command to ensure that package.json file has been created in the Todo directory

```
ls
```

- ### INSTALL EXPRESS.JS
- Install ExpressJs and create the routes directory

 Express.js allows you to define routes for handling different HTTP requests (e.g., GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) and their corresponding responses.
 Express is a framework for Node.js, therefore a lot of things developers would have programmed is already taken care of out of the box. Therefore, it simplifies development, and abstracts a lot of low-level details. For example, Express helps to define routes of your application based on HTTP methods and URLs.
To use express, install it using npm:

```
npm install express
```
To verify if Express has been installed on your server, you can look for its presence in the package.json file of your Node.js project or globally on your server.
```
cat package.json
```
![screenshot](./screenshots/express-installed.png)

- ### Now create a file index.js with the command below

```
touch index.js
```
Install the dotenv module
```
npm install dotenv
```
**'dotenv'** is a Node.js module that loads environment variables from a .env file into the process.env object. It's commonly used in Node.js applications to manage configuration settings and sensitive information like API keys, database URIs, and other environment-specific variables. By using dotenv, you can keep sensitive information separate from your codebase and easily manage different configurations for development, testing, and production environments. It helps improve security and maintainability of your Node.js applications.

To verify if dotenv has been installed in your Node.js project directory, you can check the package.json file or look for the node_modules directory.

run the following command to vrify dotenv has been succefully installed.
```
cat package.json
```
![screenshot](./screenshots/dotenv.png)

Open the index.js file with the command below
```
vim index.js 
```

**PS**: you can use your prefered command line text editor viz: vim, Emacs, nano, neovim, sublime text, atom, etc. 

***ðŸ¤—Vim and Nano are my most preffered command-line text editor ðŸ˜Š***

paste the code bellow in the vim text editor
```
const express = require('express');
require('dotenv').config();
 
const app = express();
 
const port = process.env.PORT || 5000;
 
app.use((req, res, next) => {
res.header("Access-Control-Allow-Origin", "\*");
res.header("Access-Control-Allow-Headers", "Origin, X-Requested-With, Content-Type, Accept");
next();
});
 
app.use((req, res, next) => {
res.send('Welcome to Express');
});
 
app.listen(port, () => {
console.log(`Server running on port ${port}`)
});
```
save and exit a file in vim using the command bellow

```
Press: esc
type: :wq
```
N/B: Notice that we have specified to use port 5000 in the code. This will be required later when we go on the browser.

![image](./screenshots/serverrunning.png)
Now we need to open this port in EC2 Security Groups


![image](./screenshots/portoppened.png)
Inbound rule allowed on port 5000

Open up your preffered browser and try to access your serverâ€™s Public IP or Public DNS name followed by port :5000
```
http://<PublicIP-or-PublicDNS>:5000
```
```
http://18.117.240.107/:5000
```
***PS: Public IP addresses of ec2 instances are ephemeral- they change each time you stop and start an instance.***

- ### Routes
Our Todo applicaion will be tasked with perfoming three actions.
1. Create a new task
2. Display list of all tasks
3. Delete a completed task

Each task will be associated with some particular endpoint and will use different standard HTTP request methods: ***POST, GET, DELETE.***
For each task, we need to create routes that will define various endpoints that the To-do app will depend on. So let us create a routes folder.
```
mkdir routes
```
Enter the routes directory
```
cd routes
```
Now, create a file ***api.js*** with the command below
```
touch api.js
```
You can open the api.js file with your favourite command line text editor and post the code below. **I'll use vim ðŸ¥°**
```
const express = require ('express');
const router = express.Router();
 
router.get('/todos', (req, res, next) => {
 
});
 
router.post('/todos', (req, res, next) => {
 
});
 
router.delete('/todos/:id', (req, res, next) => {
 
})
 
module.exports = router;
```
Let's create the Models directory.

- ### MODELS ###
Now comes the interesting part, since the app is going to make use of Mongodb which is a NoSQL database, we need to create a model.
- A model is at the heart of JavaScript based applications, and it is what makes it interactive.
We will also use models to define the database schema . This is important so that we will be able to define the fields stored in each Mongodb document. 


In essence, the Schema is a blueprint of how the database will be constructed, including other data fields that may not be required to be stored in the database. These are known as virtual properties.

- To create a Schema and a model, install mongoose which is a Node.js package that makes working with mongodb easier.

Change directory back Todo folder with 
```
cd .. 
```
***N/B: .. takes you one directory behind***

and install Mongoose
